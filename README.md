## Installing
- ```git clone``` the repo
- run ```npm i``` to install the required packages

## Usage
- Run ```node index.js``` to start the generator
- Answer the prompts until you've added info for all employees on your team
- The "What do you want to do?" prompt repeats ad infinitum until you select ```exit```

The HTML page is saved to the ```output``` directory as ```team.html``` 

### Contributing
You're welcome to either fork the repo or submit a pull request with an update. This was a homework assignment, however, so it's not meant to be fancy or robust.

### Tests
run ```npm test``` (or ```npm run test```) to run the included jest tests.
